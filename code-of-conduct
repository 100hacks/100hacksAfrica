This document aims to make 100hacks a place for everyone to feel welcome. 
The rules, guidelines, and code of conduct that follow apply to all 100hacks subgroups/events.

Rules and Guidelines
Hackers are diverse and complex, with many different interests and passions. 
These rules are in place so that everyone can feel comfortable participating in 100hacks. 
If you think they need editing or don't cover something important, please send a "pull request" to start the discussion.

Our guiding principle can be summarized here: 
- "Empower each other" 
- "Respect each other weakness and strength"
- "Champion each other"

The Rules
These are the rules/the things this space is not for. 
We tried to keep them short. Breaking any of these will result in your prompt removal from 100hacks.

No spam.
No harassment, including personal attacks.
No illegal/pirated content, requests for it, or information regarding the distribution of it.
No telling people they or their content is not welcome in 100hacks Hackathon. 
If you think a content does not belong in 100hacks, report the content or message to an admin. 
If you make other people feel unwelcome in 100hacks, we will remove you from the group.
 
Inclusivity Statement
100hacks Hackathon is the all-inclusive hackathons community.
We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. 
Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. 
Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, 
ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, 
and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, 
including participants with disabilities. There is no one true hacker.

Our community prioritizes marginalized people's safe existence in the community. 
We will not tolerate posts encouraging:

-Insensitivity toward boundary statements, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you"
-Racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviors or assumptions
